Etherium Miner is a Python-based cookie clicker game. You play this game in the console. Let me get ChatGPT to explain to you how to run the game outside of Replit:

To install and run a Python game from GitHub, you will need to follow these general steps:

1. **Install Python:** Make sure that Python is installed on your computer. You can download and install the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

2. **Install Git:** Install Git, a version control system, which will allow you to download the game's source code from GitHub. You can download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

3. **Clone the repository:** Clone the game's repository from GitHub using the Git command line tool or a Git client like GitKraken or Sourcetree. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the game's code and run the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

   Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the game's repository on GitHub.

4. **Install dependencies:** You will revieve errors in the console if the depndencies are not met.

5. **Run the game:** Once all the dependencies are installed, you can run the game by running the main Python script in the game's directory. The name of the main script varies from game to game, so check the game's documentation for instructions on how to run it. Typically, you can run the game by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   Replace `main.py` with the name of the game's main script.

That's it! You should now be able to run the Python game from GitHub on your computer. If you encounter any issues or errors, refer to the game's documentation or seek help from the game's community or the game's developers.
