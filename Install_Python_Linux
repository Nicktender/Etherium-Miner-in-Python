Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to help you install Python on a Linux system:

1. Open your terminal emulator, which can be found in your applications menu.

2. Enter the following command to update your system's package manager: 

```
sudo apt-get update
```

3. Once the update is complete, enter the following command to install Python 3:

```
sudo apt-get install python3
```

4. The package manager will download and install Python 3 along with any dependencies. This may take a few minutes to complete.

5. To verify that Python was installed correctly, enter the following command:

```
python3 --version
```

This will display the version of Python that was installed.

That's it! Python is now installed on your Linux system. You can start using Python by entering the Python interpreter in the terminal by typing `python3` and pressing enter.
