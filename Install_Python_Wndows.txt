Open your web browser and go to the official Python website at www.python.org/downloads.

Click on the "Download Python" button on the homepage.

You will be redirected to a page with the latest version of Python available for download. Scroll down to the "Files" section and click on the "Windows" button to download the installer for Windows.

Once the download is complete, navigate to the download location and double-click on the downloaded installer file. The filename will look something like "python-3.9.5-amd64.exe" depending on the version you downloaded.

The installer will launch and display the Python Setup wizard. Click "Install Now" to install Python with the default options.

The installer will begin the installation process. You may see a progress bar or some other indication of the installation status. This may take a few minutes to complete.

Once the installation is complete, you will see a message indicating that Python was installed successfully. Click "Close" to exit the installer.

That's it! Python is now installed on your Windows computer. To verify that Python was installed correctly, open the Command Prompt (press the Windows key + R, type "cmd" and press Enter) and type "python" (without the quotes) at the prompt. If Python is installed correctly, you should see the Python version number and the Python prompt ">>>" appear.
